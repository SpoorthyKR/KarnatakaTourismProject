	<b> <u> UDUPI</u></b>
<p>Sixty kilometers from Mangalore, is the temple town of Udupi, famous for its Krishna temple established in the 13th 
century by the great Sanskrit philosopher, Madhavacharya. The temple attracts pilgrims from all over India and is also 
a centre for the Dvaita philosophy. Udipi is also the district headquarters and is the third-most important city of
 Karnataka, after Bangalore and Mangalore. The economy is based on agriculture and fishing, as well as small scale 
 industries such as food processing, dairy and cashew production. It is also developing into a hub for the software 
 industry. Udipi is synonymous with the world-famous Udipi cuisine, which is served all over India in the efficiently-run Udipi restaurants,
 famous for dosas, idlis and other snacks. The tradition of this cuisine started in the great kitchens of the Krishna 
Temple which serve meals in the form of prasada to the thousands of devotees who come to pray at the holy shrine.</p>
