<p>Karnataka, like other Indian states, has a parliamentary system of government with two democratically elected houses,
 the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council. The Legislative Assembly consists of 224 members who are elected
 for five-year terms.[56] The Legislative Council is a permanent body of 75 members with one-third (25 members) 
 retiring every two years.The government of Karnataka is headed by the Chief Minister who is chosen by the ruling party
 members of the Legislative Assembly. The Chief Minister, along with the council of ministers, drives the legislative 
 agenda and exercises most of the executive powers.[57] However, the constitutional and formal head of the state is the
 Governor who is appointed for a five-year term by the President of India on the advice of the Union government.The 
 people of Karnataka also elect 28 members to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament.[59] The members
 of the state Legislative Assembly elect 12 members to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament.
For administrative purposes, Karnataka has been divided into four revenue divisions, 49 sub-divisions, 29 districts, 
175 taluks and 745 hoblies/revenue circles.[60] The administration in each district is headed by a Deputy Commissioner
 who belongs to the Indian Administrative Service and is assisted by a number of officers belonging to Karnataka state 
 services.  </p>
